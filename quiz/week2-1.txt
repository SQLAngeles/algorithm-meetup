[1.1] Implement Stack using singly linked list. POP and PUSH excuted in O(1)

[1.2] Implement Queue using singly linked list. ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE excuted in O(1)

[2] Implement Queue using Stacks
The problem is opposite of this post. We are given a stack data structure with push and pop operations, the task is to implement a queue using instances of stack data structure and operations on them.

[3] Write a stack client Parentheses that reads in a text stream from standard input and uses a stack to determine whether its parentheses are properly balanced. For example, your program should print true for [()]{}{[()()]()} and false for [(])
